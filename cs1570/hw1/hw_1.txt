1. How to buy a snickers from a vending machine:
  Retrieve wallet from pocket then open it to check if there is sufficient funds
      If wallet contains no $0.5, $0.10, $0.25, $1, $5, $10, or $20, cancel the operation
      If wallet does contain $0.5, $0.10, $0.25, $1, $5, $10, or $20 check to see if the amount of money is greater than or equal to the price of a snickers
          If amount of money is less than the amount needed to purchase a snickers, then cancel the operation
          If amount of money is greater than or equal to the amount needed to purchase a snickers, then proceed with the operation
  Place sufficient funds into vending machine
      If the vending machine rejects dollar bills, then flatten out dollar bill and put it back in
      If vending machine rejects dollar bill, try using a different bill instead
  Locate the numpad combination for a snickers bar
  Once numpad combination for a snickers is located, begin pressing combination into the numpad
      If an incorrect unit is pressed, cancel and type in numbers again
  After correct combination is pressed, hit enter
  If snickers falls down, then retrieve the candy bar
      If money greater than the amount needed to purchase a snickers is used, retrieve change
  If snickers bar gets stuck in the vending machine, bang on the vending machine
  If snickers bar is still stuck, restart from the beginning of the algorithm

2. How to progress through a maze from start to finish:
    From the starting point, hug the right-hand wall until an exit is located
    If exit is found, maze is completed
    If (somehow) no exit is located, follow the right-hand wall until the starting point is located, then try again

3. How to find all words in a 18x19 word search:
  In row 1, 1x1 through 18x1, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions
      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 2
      If no word is located, proceed to row 2
  In row 2, 1x2 through 18x2, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions

      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 4
      If no word is located, proceed to row 4
  In row 4, 1x4 through 18x4, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions
      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 5
      If no word is located, proceed to row 5
  In row 5, 1x5 through 18x5, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions
      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 6
      If no word is located, proceed to row 6
  In row 6, 1x6 through 18x6, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions
      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 7
      If no word is located, proceed to row 7

  In row 8, 1x8 through 18x8, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions
      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 9
      If no word is located, proceed to row 9
  In row 9, 1x9 through 18x9, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions
      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 10
      If no word is located, proceed to row 10
  In row 10, 1x10 through 18x10, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions
      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 11
      If no word is located, proceed to row 11
  In row 11, 1x11 through 18x11, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions
      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 12
      If no word is located, proceed to row 12
  In row 12, 1x12 through 18x12, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions
      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 13
      If no word is located, proceed to row 13
  In row 13, 1x13 through 18x13, search for word from the left, right, up, down, and all for diagonal directions
      If word is located, circle it, cross out the corresponding word in the word search, then proceed to row 14
      If no word is located, proceed to row 14
